### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) account and a connection string.
- Accounts for Clerk, Stripe, TMDB, Cloudinary, and Mailtrap to get the required API keys.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ngovanloc123/QuickShow.git
    cd QuickShow
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (`server`):**
    - Navigate to the server directory:
      ```bash
      cd server
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory by copying the example below.
    - Run the development server:
      ```bash
      npm run server
      ```
    - The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend (`client`):**
    - Navigate to the client directory from the root:
      ```bash
      cd client
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory by copying the example below.
    - Run the development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - The client will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

### Environment Variables

You need to create `.env` files in both the `client` and `server` directories.
